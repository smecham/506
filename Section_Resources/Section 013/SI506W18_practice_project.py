# For Part 2, you should create a file called `SI506W18_practice_project.py`. In that file, you should write code (including all/any imports you need) to get and cache all of the data you will need to get and cache for your project.

# It is OK to use code from class for this, but make sure you understand what it does.

# Your code should contain at least a couple comments explaining what it does.

# In this file, you should do some investigation on that data â€” get a good understanding of what data you can get and what pieces of it might be interesting to you, how to access them from the nested data, etc.

# This will be graded on 

#- Whether it runs and works
#- Whether it does indeed get and cache all data you have explained that you need for your project (in Part 1)
#- Whether there are print statements showing evidence that you understand the nested data you are working with

#It is OK to include comments with questions/curiosities, but you should prioritize understanding what your code does and how it will be used in your project. This is code you should be able to translate directly to your project file.
